								<p><span><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> AmericasBarometer</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) is an academic institution hosted by Vanderbilt University that began with the study of democratic values in Costa Rica, but today carries out surveys in much of Latin America, Canada, the United States, and the Caribbean. In 2004, LAPOP established the AmericasBarometer as multi-country, regularly conducted survey of democratic values and behaviors in the Americas, and the first round included voting-age respondents from 11 countries. The 2014 round, which marks the latest round of surveys of the AmericasBarometer, includes surveys conducted in 28 countries across the Americas and more than 50,000 interviews.</p>
<p>LAPOP collected opinions on major problems facing the country and community, threats to security, attitudes towards the country's political system, and trust in government institutions. Also measured were respondents' participation in community organizations, attitudes towards government critics, voting behavior, confidence in local government, and the prevalence of crime. Demographic information collected includes nationality, ethnicity, native language, age, gender, education level, occupation, religion, and whether the respondent lives in an urban or rural area.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> To measure democratic values and behaviors in the Americas.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p>The 2014 AmericasBarometer study is based on interviews with 53,566 respondents in 28 countries. Nationally representative surveys of voting age adults were conducted in all major languages, using face-to-face interviews in Latin America and the Caribbean and web surveys in the United States and Canada. Samples in each country were developed using a multi-stage probabilistic design (with quotas at the household level for most countries), and were stratified by major regions of the country, size of municipality and by urban and rural areas within
municipalities. For more information on sampling, please see the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP), 2014 Methodology Documentation or visit the <a href = "http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/">LAPOP</a> Web site.</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Cross-sectional</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Non-institutionalized voting age adults living in Latin America, Canada, the United States, and the Caribbean.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Dwelling</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> face-to-face interview, web-based survey</span></p>
